<details>
<summary> NOTES </summary>

**Agenda**: Dmitri gave an intro into the suggested working 

**PROPOSAL**: EDV calls focus on the following:

Spec
Test vectors
Remaining 1.0 of features (history api, etc).
securekey PR
pagination
history api
**All** +1's

**PROPOSAL**: EDV calls spin up 3 repos. 1) EDV Spec repo. 2) Test suite / test vectors. 3) Example implementation (client, server).

**All** +1's

**PROPOSAL**: Based on what I heard: Incoming issues will be triaged on call within two weeks. Issues that have been triaged will have tags associated with them, and a directly responsible individual assigned. If no one volunteers, the issue will be considered to unimportant to keep open.

**All** +1's

Manu: what do we want to do with the current list of issues in the repo?

Orie: As we spin up the new repo editors will label the relevant ones "Pending Move to EDV/Hub" all other issues 

Eric: Question about when cross group updates will occur

Orie: In favour of not setting up anything formal yet

Manu: Lets rely on more informal cross sub-group overlap for context sharing

Manu: Propose to move on to outstanding feature issues

Troy: *Gave a quick summary of their existing proposal for batch capability in an EDV*

Tobias: *Gave a quick summary of the proposal for a history API on an EDV*

Justin Bingham - Co-editor of the SOLID specification

**Agenda**

A proposal was made to the working group to shift the call structure to alternating topic calls between Hubs and EDVs

**PROPOSAL**: The SDS WG will change to alternating calls where we will focus on EDVs on one call and Hubs on the other call. Each group will report into the the other group at least once a month.

Proposal passed, no objections noted.

**Introductions / Re-introductions**

- Jace from Bloom re-introduced himself

**Replication Discussion**

- Orie gave a brief reflection on our prior discussion on replication, touching on topics such as

    - filtered / partial replication, are we looking for EDV's to support only syncing a subset of information

    - how does this intersect with the AuthZ model we select

    - what role the client plays and what role the server play, e.g is it server controlled, client controlled or somewhere in between like client controlled but server facilitated.

- Adrian asked the question "what would we do differently to other DBs like CouchDB"

- Orie answered Adrians question, saying right now it is not defined but the likely solution will be similar however there are quite unique constraints that come about when the data is client side encrypted.

- Adrian asked how does an architecture like this protect against a honey pot style approached

- Daniel B make the observation that AuthZ is an important component in syncing that directly relates to the trust model assumed between clients and instances

- Andreas stated that the real problem in syncing between instances is the model we assume around consistency i.e do we assume strong consistency?

- Dave L responded to Adrians query by stating his assumption is that the server would not have the ability to decrypt the documents only perhaps Zcaps required to make authorized calls to another instance

- Michael asked is the replication model assumed multi-master or not? And also how granular does the sync get?

- Chris asked if we are going to adopt a model like CouchDB's replication do we want to invest in attempting to standardised this?

- Daniel B shared previous experiences with couch db, finding it in-compatible with their requirements for hubs

- Orie responded to Michaels partial sync strategy by explaining how CouchDB works with map-reduce queries, citing npm as a popular project that leverages CouchDB, but also noted the distinct difficulties that are introduced when the data is client encrypted.

- Adrian expressed frustration at the introduction of hubs into the conversation, saying that he finds them orthogonal and a distraction to the discussion on sync and replication. He clarified his issue w.r.t the honey pot question saying by encrypting we create a key management issue where clients need HSMs to interact with an EDV.

- Dmitri agreed that adrians general question around key management is good, but to an extent out of scope for this working group.

- Manu in response to the question around standardizing a replication model like couchdb said it is potentially a very difficult and involved task. Furthermore he asked had anyone implemented a model like this? Or instead can we talk about a simpler replication model like uni-directional replication.

- Zokama asked why is couchdb the main focus of the discussion?

- Michael echoed the same sentiments as Zokama

- Tobias responded to adrians question saying he does not expect clients to need an HSM to interact with an EDV, instead an EDV client will need to be able to perform crypto operations but where the keys used are sourced from will likely be varied e.g HSM SSM or derived from knowledge factors like a password.

- Orie asked to re-frame the discussion back into use-cases for replication. He also proposed whether we can initially constrain the conversation to uni-directional replication (the simple case) before the more complex derivatives.

- Dmitri brought the conversation back to some core properties uni-directional vs bi-directional, partial vs full sync and how the sync is performed. He also echoed Orie's ask to start simple w.r.t sync and replication.

- Daniel said he has done a tone of research on sync and replication and wants to be sure we build a system that caters for the more complicated sync scenarios and is committed to that cause.

- Manu echoed Dmitri and Ories ask to work on uni-directional replication initially and asked us to work on more terse use cases that describe the business need.

- Adrian asked for the use-cases to be more granular and relatable than just backup and recovery

- Andreas pointed out there are other examples of P2P replication protocols that can be looked at for sources of inspiration.

- Michael asked what sort of change tracking is build into an EDV to date?

- Manu asked for those using the terminology of "master slave" to instead move towards language like "primary secondary" clarifying he doesn't believe anyone on the call means anything bad when they use it, just wanting to drive the ecosystem towards more inclusive language.

- Dmitri responded to Michaels query by saying it is partially dependent on what use-cases we use to guide us.

Intro's / Re-intro's and announcements

Zokama - Introduced himself
Kaylia - New job now the ecosystem director for the linux foundation for public health
Revisited the naming question

- Group chartered as the Secure Data Storage WG and as per the vote in the WG we have renamed the current work item to Confidential Storage, there are appears to be some confusion about this relationship it was clarified during the call.

- Adrian proposed for the spec to be renamed to EDV (encrypted data vaults) and to remove the hubs section from the current spec because there is a legal distinction between EDV and hubs.

- Chris in reference to Adrians argument re-raised the point about hubs having access to un-encrypted data, Dmitri asked Chris to create an issue to capture this if it does not already exist.

Replication

- Dmitri explained how we got to this topic: authorization model -> how do we refer to resources (identifiers) -> how do we replicate these resources between provider instances.

- The conversation around replication was framed in the context of the use cases document

- Adrian G gave some examples about how he would like replication to occur, citing an example use case involving drop box and a password manager

- Chris W asked for clarification on the sharing data usecase, "is that sharing everything or only a subset?". Dmitri clarified that the current usecase is very general and the granularity of sharing is dependent on the authz model.

- Adrian asked whether backup is related to replication and whether it exists at just the hub level. Orie said he believes replication is at the EDV (CS) level.

- Dave asked whether replication is invisible to the client or co-ordinated by the client? I.e is replication achieved by the client co-ordinating it, or is it something two EDV servers do together without the client.

- Dave proposed "client-controlled replication"would be a potential feature for the spec, "server-controlled replication" would not be.

- Daniel B proposed what properties he would like to see from replication which is that Alice can have multiple instances of her hub that when a change is sent to one, it is broadcasted to all meaning if one provider fails she has appropriate redundancy.

- Dmitri clarified what he called a difference between client visible vs client controlled replication citing Orie's example of couch db, which is replication that is client visible but server controlled, where as another option is for replication to be client visible and client controlled.

- Orie made the point that not all replicas may be equal citing that some replicates due to storage requirements or bandwidth might not be able to hold an entire dataset.

- Dave clarified further about client controlled replication, asking is it the client setting a setting on the EDV or is it actually performing the copy. He also pointed out that when the server instances are responsible for syncing differential replication (partial replication) would be difficult, as the server has no access to the plain text data.

- Orie pointed out that encrypted indexes could offer a solution to achieve differential replication (partial replication) between two server instances. Dave agreed that we could explore a solution based on this. Chris agreed but was not convinced about dynamic filtered based replication.
