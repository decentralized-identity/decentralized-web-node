# Secure Data Store

## [Latest Editors Draft](https://identity.foundation/secure-data-store/)

### From the Charter

> Create one or more specifications to establish a foundational layer for secure data storage (including personal data), specifically
data models for storage and transport, syntax, data at rest protection, CRUD API, access control, synchronization, and at least a
minimum viable HTTP-based interface compatible with W3C DIDs/VCs.

> The [Identity Hubs](./identity-hub) and [Encrypted Data Vaults](./encrypted-data-vaults) documents will be used as a use case, requirements, and technical input for the
collaborative effort.
