      <p>
We store a significant amount of sensitive data online including personally
identifying information, trade secrets, sensitive imagery, and customer
information. The data that we store should be encrypted in transit and at rest
but is often not protected in an appropriate manner.
This specification describes a privacy-respecting mechanism for storing,
indexing, and retrieving encrypted data at a storage provider. It is often
useful when an individual or organization wants to protect data in a way that
the storage provider cannot view, analyze, aggregate, or resell the data.
This approach also ensures that application data is portable and protected
from storage provider data breaches.

        <h3>Ecosystem Overview</h3>

        <p>
This section describes the roles of the core actors and the relationships
between them in an ecosystem where this specification is expected
to be useful. A role is an abstraction that might be implemented in many
different ways. The separation of roles suggests likely interfaces and
protocols for standardization. The following roles are introduced in this
specification:
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt>storage agent</dt>
          <dd>
A role an <a>entity</a> might perform by
          </dd>
          <dt>storage provider</dt>
          <dd>
A role an <a>entity</a> might perform by
          </dd>
          <dt>web application</dt>
          <dd>
A role an <a>entity</a> might perform by
          </dd>

        <h3>Use Cases and Requirements</h3>

        <p>
The USE-CASES document outlines a number
of key topics that readers might find useful, including:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
TBD
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
As a result of documenting and analyzing the use cases document, the following
desirable ecosystem characteristics were identified for this specification:

  <section class="informative">
    <h2>Privacy Considerations</h2>

    <p>
This section details the general privacy considerations and specific privacy
implications of deploying this specification into production environments.
    </p>

  </section>

  <section class="informative">
    <h2>Security Considerations</h2>

    <p>
There are a number of security considerations that implementers should be
aware of when processing data described by this specification. Ignoring or
not understanding the implications of this section can result in
security vulnerabilities.
    </p>

    <p>
While this section attempts to highlight a broad set of security
considerations, it is not a complete list. Implementers are urged to seek the
advice of security and cryptography professionals when implementing mission
critical systems using the technology outlined in this specification.
    </p>

  </section>

  <section class="informative">
    <h2>Accessibility Considerations</h2>

    <p>
There are a number of accessibility considerations implementers should be
aware of when processing data described in this specification. As with any web
standards or protocols implementation, ignoring accessibility issues makes
this information unusable to a large subset of the population. It is important
to follow accessibility guidelines and standards, such as [[WCAG21]], to ensure
all people, regardless of ability, can make use of this data. This is
especially important when establishing systems utilizing cryptography, which
have historically created problems for assistive technologies.
    </p>

    <p>
This section details the general accessibility considerations to take into
account when utilizing this data model.
    </p>

  <section class="informative">
    <h2>Internationalization Considerations</h2>

    <p>
There are a number of internationalization considerations implementers should be
aware of when publishing data described in this specification. As with any web
standards or protocols implementation, ignoring internationalization makes it
difficult for data to be produced and consumed across a disparate set of
languages and societies, which would limit the applicability of the
specification and significantly diminish its value as a standard.
    </p>

    <p>
This section outlines general internationalization considerations to take into
account when utilizing this data model.
